Some simplifications to speed up the prototype:

Testing Suite
One language, Python.
Assume only 1 test, and that test has only one (set?) of input(s).  The output is also trivial.

Essays and Math can be rolled into one Activity type.

Need Create/Modify/Delete, but copy can wait.

A broad system-wide backup and restore.

No groups for Activities, so that UI can wait.

Similarly, all TA/TMs are assigned to all students in the course (as is the default).

The database was brought up, but not discussed.
